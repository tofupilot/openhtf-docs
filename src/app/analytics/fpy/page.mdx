# First-pass Yield

First-pass Yield (FPY) is a critical metric in production and manufacturing that measures the percentage of products passing all tests and inspections the first time, without any need for rework or repair. It is an essential indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of a manufacturing or testing process. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Definition

First-pass Yield, also known as Throughput Yield, is calculated as the number of units passing all required tests and inspections on the first attempt, divided by the total number of units tested. A higher FPY indicates a more efficient process with fewer defects and less waste.

**Formula:**

```jsx
FPY = (Number of units passing all tests on the first attempt) / (Total number of units tested)
```

## Importance

Improving FPY helps reduce waste, lowers production costs, and enhances overall product quality. It also minimizes the time and resources spent on rework and repairs, contributing to a more efficient and streamlined production process.

## Calculation

To visualize your tests' first-pass yield, simply import them on TofuPilot and it'll do the rest.
