# Manufacturing test analytics

OpenHTF standardizes test scripts and report formats. This section covers key analytics from these reports, their value in assessing test performance and product quality, and provides practical examples. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Introduction

A test execution framework like OpenHTF is highly useful for standardizing the writing of test scripts in your production processes. Once these scripts are deployed, they generate a report and attachments for each test, which quickly results in a large volume of data to process.

These reports provide significant insights into test performance, production efficiency, and product quality. Analyzing this data is crucial for optimizing processes and improving outcomes. For example:

- **First-pass yield (FPY)**: Percentage of units passing tests without re-test or rework. Higher values show better quality.

- **Cycle time**: Time spent per test cycle. Shorter times improve production speed.

- **Process capability**: Measures test results against limits. Helps control accuracy and spot quality variations.

## In-house analytics

If you want to compute these analytics, you could create your own algorithms using Excel, custom logging solutions, or in-house scripts. However, this approach has several drawbacks:

- üí∞ **High Costs**: Custom development is expensive and time-consuming.
- üê¢ **Low Performance**: Handling large data volumes can slow things down.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Maintenance**: Keeping custom tools updated is costly and tedious.
- üö´ **Focus Shift**: Instead of improving test stations, you're spending time building tools
- üîì **Security Risks**: Sensitive data may be exposed due to improper permissions, especially on supplier systems.
