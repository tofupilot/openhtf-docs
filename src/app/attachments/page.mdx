## Overview

Hardware tests often generate extra data, such as images, that can't be captured as measurements. OpenHTF allows you to attach these files to the test record.

With the <TofuPilotLink utmMedium="attachments-overview"/> integration, attachments are uploaded automatically and you can access and download them directly from your TofuPilot workspace.

## Files

You can attach binary data or files generated during the test.

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
import openhtf as htf

def phase_attachment(test):
    # Attach a binary log with the identifier "test_attachment"
    test.attach("test_attachment", "This is test log data.".encode("utf-8"))
    return htf.PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = htf.Test(phase_attachment)
    test.execute(lambda: "PCB0001")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Files by path

You can attach larger or pre-existing files from disk or URL.

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
import openhtf as htf

def phase_file_attachment(test):
    test.attach_from_file("/path/to/your/logfile.txt")
    return htf.PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = htf.Test(phase_file_attachment)
    test.execute(lambda: "PCB0001")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## TofuPilot integration

The <TofuPilotLink utmMedium="phases-integration" /> integration is natively compatible with OpenHTF phases.

To integrate TofuPilot, install the open-source client:

```sh
pip install tofupilot
```

Add it to your test like this:

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
import openhtf as htf
from tofupilot.openhtf import TofuPilot

def phase_file_attachment(test):
    test.attach_from_file("/path/to/your/logfile.txt")
    return htf.PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = htf.Test(phase_file_attachment)
    with TofuPilot(test):                   # just works™️
      test.execute(lambda: "PCB001")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can access attachments in a dedicated section of the run page, where you can open them in the browser or download them.

## Advanced use cases

You can use extended features for attachements advanced use cases.

### Access attachments during execution

You can load and access attached files during test execution.

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
import openhtf as htf

def phase_attachment(test):
    # Attach some data
    test.attach("test_attachment", "Attachment data".encode("utf-8"))

    # Retrieve and print the attached data
    test_attachment = test.get_attachment("test_attachment")
    print(test_attachment.data)

    return htf.PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = htf.Test(phase_attachment)
    test.execute(lambda: "PCB0001")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
