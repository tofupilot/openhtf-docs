# Attachments

You can attach files or raw data to a test record. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

When running hardware tests, you usually need to store additional data like pictures, which can't be captured as standard measurements. OpenHTF allows you to store these files as attachments.

With TofuPilot integration, attachments will automatically be uploaded, organized, and linked to your test runs.

## Files

You can attach binary data or files generated during the test using the `test.attach` function.

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
from openhtf import Test, PhaseResult

def attachment_phase(test):
    # Attach a binary log with the identifier "log_data"
    test.attach("log_data", "This is test log data.".encode("utf-8"))
    return PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = Test(attachment_phase)
    test.execute(lambda: "SI051AB7B0001")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Files by path

You can attach larger or pre-existing files from disk using `test.attach_file`.

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
from openhtf import Test, PhaseResult

def file_attachment_phase(test):
    # Attach a file from the specified path with the identifier "log_file"
    test.attach_file("log_file", "/path/to/your/logfile.txt")
    return PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = Test(attachment_phase)
    test.execute(lambda: "SI051AB7B0001")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Files by URL

TODO FÃ©lix: are there a way to attach files URL?

## TofuPilot integration

When using the TofuPilot integration, all OpenHTF attachment methods are fully supported. Your attachments are automatically uploaded, organized, and linked to your tests.

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
from openhtf import Test, PhaseResult

def attachment_phase(test):
    test.attach("test_attachment", "Attachment data".encode("utf-8"))
    return PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = Test(attachment_phase)
    test.execute(lambda: "SI051AB7B0001")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Attachments are available in a dedicated section of the run page, where they can be opened directly in the browser or downloaded.

## Advanced use cases

### Access attachments during execution

To load and access attached files during test execution, use the `test.get_attachment` function.

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
from openhtf import Test, PhaseResult

def attachment_phase(test):
    # Attach some data
    test.attach("test_attachment", "Attachment data".encode("utf-8"))

    # Retrieve and print the attached data
    test_attachment = test.get_attachment("test_attachment")
    print(test_attachment)

    return PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = Test(attachment_phase)
    test.execute(lambda: "SI051AB7B0001")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
