# Coding Guidelines

## Test Structure and Organization

We recommend performing a single read or write operation on the unit under test (uut) per phase.

## Logging and Error Handling

## Test Data and Attachments

## Decorators syntax

## Code Modularity and Reusability

## Documentation and Annotations

## Use of Test Metadata

## Testing and Debugging

## Clean Exit and Hardware Reset

You can have two different syntaxes. Technically, these syntaxes can be mixed, but as a matter of convention you should always use one or the other within a single decorator call.
We will use the syntaxe in the script below for all the examples.

```python {{title: 'main.py'}}
import openhtf as htf
from openhtf.output.callbacks import json_factory


@htf.measures(
    htf.Measurement("first_measurement"),
    htf.Measurement("second_measurement"),
    htf.Measurement("third"),
    htf.Measurement("fourth"),
)
def example_phase(test):
    test.measurements.first_measurement = "First!"
    test.measurements.second_measurement = "Second!"

    for measurement in ("third", "fourth"):
        test.measurements[measurement] = measurement + " is the best!"

    return htf.PhaseResult.CONTINUE


def main():
    test = htf.Test(example_phase)
    test.add_output_callbacks(json_factory.OutputToJSON("test_result.json", indent=2))
    test.execute(lambda: "PCB001")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Import openhtf

In this documentation we will rely on the examples provided in the main repository. The `openhtf` syntax will be the same in all examples.

```python
import openhtf as htf
```
