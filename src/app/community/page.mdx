## About

We’re a team of manufacturing test engineers and long-time OpenHTF users. The lack of documentation was constantly slowing us down, so we documented it ourselves to help others avoid the same issues.

This pushed us further. With <TofuPilotLink utmMedium="community" />, we built a plug-and-play database and analytics for manufacturing tests. It works out of the box with OpenHTF and can save your team a lot of time and effort.
