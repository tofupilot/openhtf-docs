## About us

We’re robotics manufacturing test engineers using OpenHTF. The lack of documentation slowed us down, so we created our own to help others. Then we went further and built <TofuPilotLink utmMedium="community" />—a plug-and-play database and analytics tool for manufacturing tests. It works seamlessly with OpenHTF, saving your team a lot of time and effort.
