## About us

We’re robotics manufacturing test engineers using OpenHTF. The lack of documentation slowed us down, so we created our own to help others. Then we went further and built <TofuPilotLink utmMedium="community" />—a plug-and-play database and analytics tool for manufacturing tests. It works seamlessly with OpenHTF, saving your team a lot of time.

## OpenHTF today
OpenHTF has been a key tool for our team. Unsure about its current maintenance and future, we visited its founders, John and Joe, in Mountain View, and spoke with Akash, who now leads its maintenance at Waymo. We learned that OpenHTF is actively maintained by a dedicated team of five engineers, with no internal forks or breaking changes expected.
