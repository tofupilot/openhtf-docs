# Device Under Test

OpenHTF requires that a Device Under Test (DUT) ID is set each time a test is executed. If a DUT ID is not provided at the start, the test will begin immediately, assuming the DUT ID will be set later. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  OpenHTF will raise an exception when the test completes if a DUT ID has not
  been set.
</Note>

## Providing DUT ID at Runtime

The simplest way to provide a DUT ID is by prompting the user for it. OpenHTF provides a built-in `user_input` method for this purpose.

```python {title: 'main.py'}
from openhtf import Test, PhaseResult
from openhtf.plugs import user_input

# Define the test phase
def power_on_test(test):
    print('Power on.')
    return PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = Test(power_on_test)
    # prompt_for_test_start prompts the operator for a DUT ID
    test.execute(test_start=user_input.prompt_for_test_start())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation

- The main.py script defines a test phase (power_on_test) and creates a test instance (test) using the Test class.
- The prompt_for_test_start method prompts the operator to input a DUT ID before the test starts.

To run the script, use the following command in the virtual environment:

```sh
python main.py
```

This testbench does not use the operator UI yet, so all interactions are made through the command line.

```sh
(venv) C:\tofupilot > python main.py
Power on.

======================= test: openhtf_test  outcome: PASS ======================
```

## Providing DUT ID Statically

Alternatively, the DUT ID can be set programmatically.

```python {title: 'main.py'}
from openhtf import Test, PhaseResult

# Define the test phase
def power_on_test(test):
    print('Power on.')
    return PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    # Create a test instance with the defined phase
    test = Test(power_on_test)
    # Provide a static DUT ID for the test start
    test.execute(test_start=lambda: 'DeviceUnderTest123')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation

- The main.py script includes a test phase (power_on_test) and a test instance (test).
- A static DUT ID (DeviceUnderTest123) is provided programmatically when starting the test.

To run the script, use the following command in the virtual environment:

```sh
python main.py
```

This testbench does not use the operator UI yet, so all interactions are made through the command line.

```sh
(venv) C:\tofupilot > python main.py
Power on.

======================= test: openhtf_test  outcome: PASS ======================
```
