# Create your first test

Let's create a first test script in under five minutes. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Installation

Install OpenHTF and its dependencies using pip:

```sh
pip install openhtf six setuptools
```

We recommend setting up a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to better manage dependencies.

## First run

Create a `main.py` file in your virtual environment and copy this code.

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
import openhtf as htf

def hello_world(test):              # Define "hello_world" phase
    print('Hello world!')
    return htf.PhaseResult.CONTINUE # Continue to next phase

def main():
    test = htf.Test(hello_world)    # Define test with hello_world
    test.execute(lambda: "PCB001")  # Execute with DUT serial

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()                          # Run main function
```

Run it with:

```sh
python main.py
```

```txt {{ title: 'Terminal' }}
(venv) C:\tofupilot > python main.py
Hello world!

======================= test: openhtf_test  outcome: PASS ======================
```

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations**! You just ran your first OpenHTF test and itâ€™s a `PASS`! Easy, right?

This is a very simple OpenHTF test, running through the command line without the Operator UI yet. You'll learn to connect instruments, add measurements, and more in the next sections.
