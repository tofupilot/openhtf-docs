# Create your first test

Let's create a first test script and explore the main concepts of OpenHTF. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Installation

Install OpenHTF and its dependencies using pip:

```sh
pip install openhtf six
```

## First run

Create a file called `main.py` in the folder where you installed OpenHTF and copy this code.

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
from openhtf import Test, PhaseResult

# Define the test phase
def power_on_test(test):
    print('Power on.')
    return PhaseResult.CONTINUE

# Create a test instance with the defined phase
test = Test(power_on_test)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test.execute()
```

The `main.py` script includes a test phase and a test instance. The test phase is a function that performs a specific part of the test, while the test instance is created using the `Test` class and the defined phase.
You can find more about the `PhaseResult` parameters in the following sections.

Run it using the created virtual environment:

```sh
python main.py
```

This testbench does not use the operator UI yet, so all interactions are made through the command line.

```txt
(venv) C:\tofupilot > python main.py
Power on.

======================= test: openhtf_test  outcome: PASS ======================
```
