# Create your first test

Let's create a first test script and explore the main concepts of OpenHTF. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Installation

Install OpenHTF and its dependencies using pip:

```sh
pip install openhtf six
```

## First test script

Create a file called `main.py` in the folder where you installed OpenHTF and copy this code.

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
from openhtf import Test, PhaseResult, plugs
from openhtf.plugs.user_input import UserInput

# Define the test phase
@plugs.plug(prompts=UserInput)
def power_on_test(test, prompts):
    prompts.prompt('Power on the device and press Return.')
    test.dut_id = 'PCB12345'
    return PhaseResult.CONTINUE

# Create a test instance with the defined phase
test = Test(power_on_test)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test.execute()
```

This simple testbench interacts with the operator by displaying "Power on the device and press Return."

<Note>
  Did you know about the @ syntax in Python, called decorators? They modify
  functions or methods using other functions. For more details, see the
  [official Python
  documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator).
</Note>

## Run

Run it using the created virtual environment:

```sh
python main.py
```

This test bench does not use the operator UI yet, so all interactions are made through the command line.

```sh
(venv) C:\tofupilot > python main.py
Power on the device and press Return.
-->

================ test: openhtf_test  outcome: PASS ================
```

## Key concepts

- **Tests**: Top-level abstractions representing a sequence of steps for a Device Under Test (DUT).
- **Phases**: Logical blocks within a test, usually Python functions, that include measurements and control commands.
- **Measurements**: Data collected during tests, often with pass/fail criteria.
- **Attachments**: Additional data linked to a test, such as logs or binary files.
- **Plugs**: Interfaces connecting OpenHTF to various hardware or test equipment.

OpenHTF also offers a web-based UI for easy use in environments like manufacturing floors, allowing operators to interact with tests without deep technical knowledge.
