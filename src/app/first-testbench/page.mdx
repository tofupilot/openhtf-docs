# Running a first testbench

Let's create our first test bench and explore the basic concept of the test plan. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Create the test script

Create a file called `main.py` in the folder where you installed OpenHTF and copy this code.

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
from openhtf.plugs.user_input import UserInput
from openhtf import TestPlan

# Declare the test plan
plan = TestPlan('PCB_Test_Plan')

# Declare and add a test case to the test plan
@plan.testcase('Initial_Power_On_Test')
@plan.plug(prompts=UserInput)
def power_on_test(test, prompts):
    prompts.prompt('Power on the device.')
    test.dut_id = 'pcb_12345'

# Execute the test plan when the script is launched
if __name__ == '__main__':
    plan.no_trigger()
    plan.run()
```

This simple testbench interacts with the operator by displaying "Power on the device."

<Note>
  You may not know about the @ syntax, called decorators. It modifies functions
  or methods using other functions. For more details, see the official Python
  documentation.
</Note>

## Run in command line

Run it using the created virtual environment:

```sh
python main.py
```

This test bench does not use the OpenHTF GUI yet, so all interactions are made through the command line. The test prints "Power on the device." and indicates a PASS.

```sh
(venv) C:\tofupilot > python main.py
Power on the device.
-->

================ test: PCB_Test_Plan  outcome: PASS ================
```

## Run in operator UI

OpenHTF provides a web interface for interacting with the test operator. It guides through manual operations and displays logs and results of test phases.

Then, modify `main.py` to use the web interface:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    plan.no_trigger()
    plan.run()
```

Run the new test bench. The web interface will load automatically in your browser.

![Exploring the web interface](img/web.png)

1. **Operator Input**: Displays prompts and forms.
2. **Continue Test**: Click "Okay" to proceed.
3. **Running Status**: Shows elapsed time.
4. **Current Phase**: Displays the current phase and upcoming phases.
5. **Logs**: Lists operations and logs.

Run your test another time using the X button. You can come back to the result of the first test using the Logs interface on the side.
