# Running a first testbench

Let's create our first test bench and explore the basic concept of the test plan.

## Create the test script

Create a file called `main.py` in the folder where you installed OpenHTF and copy this code.

```python
# main.py
from openhtf.plugs.user_input import UserInput
from openhtf import TestPlan

# Declare the test plan
plan = TestPlan('PCB_Test_Plan')

# Declare and add a test case to the test plan
@plan.testcase('Initial_Power_On_Test')
@plan.plug(prompts=UserInput)
def power_on_test(test, prompts):
    prompts.prompt('Power on the device.')
    test.dut_id = 'pcb_12345'

# Execute the test plan when the script is launched
if __name__ == '__main__':
    plan.no_trigger()
    plan.run()
```

This simple testbench interacts with the operator by displaying "Power on the device."

## Run your first test

Run it using the created virtual environment:

```sh
# Windows Activate
venv\Scripts\activate 

python main.py
```

This test bench does not use the OpenHTF GUI yet, so all interactions are made through the command line. The test prints "Power on the device." and indicates a PASS.

```sh
(venv) C:\TofuPilot\doc_exp>python main.py
Power on the device.
-->

================ test: PCB_Test_Plan  outcome: PASS ================
```
