## Basic Concepts

A **test plan** is the core component where all **test phases** are defined and executed. **Configurations** control various aspects of the test plan and environment. **Forms** enable interaction with the test operator for manual operations or input. **Plugs** interface with external test equipment and resources. **Criteria** are thresholds compared against **measures** (test results) to determine pass or fail outcomes.
