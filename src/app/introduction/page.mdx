# OpenHTF

Welcome to OpenHTF, the open-source test automation framework for simple hardware testing. This documentation will help you quickly get started and master the necessary concepts to develop efficient hardware testbenches. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

OpenHTF tests hardware devices (**DUTs**) by running Python scripts (**test scripts**) that consist of ordered steps (**phases**). These tests gather data (**measurements**) to determine if the device passes or fails. Each complete execution is a **test run**, based on a reusable **test recipe**. **Stations** record and display test runs. Additional complex data can be attached to **test records**, and **plugs** enable interaction with the DUT or test equipment.

## Installation

1. **Install Python**:

   - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   - Verify the installation by running `python --version` in your command line.

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:

   - Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - **Windows**: `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - **Linux/Mac**: `source venv/bin/activate`

3. **Install OpenHTF**:
   - Install using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install openhtf six
   ```
