# Output Callbacks

You can enable automatic test report generation in JSON and other formats. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

Tracking tests is crucial for traceability and analysis, especially in production environments. OpenHTF uses output callbacks to automatically generate reports, with a default JSON format that can be customized as needed.

When integrating with <TofuPilotLink utmMedium="output-callbacks-overview" />, test results synch directly to TofuPilot without local storage, ensuring real-time remote access and reducing the risk of data loss. If needed, you can still configure additional callbacks to export results locally.

## JSON

You can enable automatic test result export in the default JSON format using `json_factory.OutputToJSON`.

<Note>Output callbacks must be added before test execution</Note>

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
from openhtf import Test, PhaseResult
from openhtf.output.callbacks import json_factory

def get_sn(test):
    test.test_record.dut_id = 'PCB001'
    return PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = Test(get_sn)
    # Exports results to JSON with pretty-printing
    test.add_output_callbacks(json_factory.OutputToJSON("test_result.json", indent=2))
    test.execute()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

A `test_result.json` file is created after execution and saved in the script folder. The file path can be changed if needed.

The general structure of an OpenHTF JSON log is as follows:

```txt
  dut_id
  start_time_millis
  end_time_millis
  outcome                    # PASS/FAIL
  metadata
    └── test_name
    └── config
    └── ...
  phases                     # Array of test phases executed
    └── name
    └── outcome              # PASS/FAIL
    └── result               # Phase-specific result details (e.g., CONTINUE)
    └── measurements
  log_records                # Array of log messages
    └── message
    └── timestamp_millis
  station_id
  code_info                  # Details about the test script (name, source code)
```

## TofuPilot integration

The <TofuPilotLink utmMedium="output-callbacks-integration" /> integration provides an output callback that automatically syncs test runs with TofuPilot.

Test runs are securely uploaded using either your or the test station's API key. They are immediately available on the "Runs" page of your workspace. Import warnings or errors can be found on the dedicated "Import Error" page.

The callback generates a default JSON OpenHTF log and attached it to the test run, capturing the full output, including custom fields. You don't need `json_factory.OutputToJSON` anymore, except if you want to store local results.

## Advanced use cases

You can handle more advanced use cases by leveraging extended features of output callbacks.

### Implement custom output format

You can implement a custom output format by creating a function to handle the test record and adding it as an output callback if the built-in format doesn’t meet your needs.

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
from openhtf import PhaseResult
from openhtf.output import callbacks

def custom_output_callback(test_record):
    with open('./custom_output.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('Custom Output\n')
        f.write(f'DUT ID: {test_record.dut_id}\n')
        f.write(f'Outcome: {test_record.outcome}\n')
        for phase in test_record.phases:
            f.write(f'Phase: {phase.name}\n')

def get_sn(test):
    test.test_record.dut_id = 'PCB001'
    return PhaseResult.CONTINUE

def main():
    test = Test(get_sn)
    test.add_output_callbacks(custom_output_callback)
    test.execute()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The output file will then be:

```txt {{ title: 'custom_output.txt' }}
Custom Output
DUT ID: PCB001
Outcome: Outcome.PASS
Phase: get_sn
```
