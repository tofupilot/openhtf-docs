# Welcome to OpenHTF

OpenHTF (Open Hardware Testing Framework) is an open-source Python framework for hardware testing. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Quick example

<Row>
  <Col>
    OpenHTF tests are Python scripts that perform a series of test steps on a Unit Under Test (UUT) involving data gathering or measurements.
    
    OpenHTF handles the setup, execution, and teardown of the test, keeps track of everything gathered and provides a pass/fail outcome.

    Here are the key concepts in OpenHTF:

      <Properties>
        <Property name="Phases">
          Steps in the test sequence that perform actions or checks.
        </Property>
        <Property name="Measurements">
          Values recorded during the test with optional pass/fail limits.
        </Property>
        <Property name="Plugs">
          Reusable components that handle external hardware/software interactions.
        </Property>
      </Properties>

  <CodeGroup title="Example">
    ```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
    import openhtf as htf
    from openhtf.plugs import plug
    from multimeter_plug import MultimeterPlug

    @plug(multimeter=MultimeterPlug)
    @htf.measures(
      htf.Measurement('voltage')
      .in_range(3.0, 3.5)
      .with_units('V'))
    def test_voltage(test, multimeter):
      voltage = multimeter.measure_voltage()
      test.measurements.voltage = voltage

    def main():
      test = htf.Test(test_voltage)
      test.execute(lambda: "PCB0001") # UUT S/N

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
    ```

    ```python {{ title: 'multimeter_plug.py' }}
    from openhtf.plugs import plug, BasePlug

    class MultimeterPlug(BasePlug):
      def __init__(self, port):
        self.port = port
        self.connection = f"Connected on {self.port}"

      def measure_voltage(self):
        return 3.3

      # Automatically called at test teardown
      def tearDown(self):
        self.connection = None
    ```

## About

Originally created at **Google** for hardware testing, OpenHTF is now used by teams worldwide, from small startups to large companies, across all stages of product development: **verification** in design, **validation** in prototyping, and **manufacturing**.
