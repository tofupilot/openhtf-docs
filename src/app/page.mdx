# Welcome to OpenHTF

OpenHTF (Open Hardware Testing Framework) is an open-source Python framework for hardware testing. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Originally created at **Google**, OpenHTF is now used by hundreds of teams worldwide, from startups to large companies, across all stages of product development: **verification** in design, **validation** in prototyping, and **manufacturing**.

<LogoCloud />

This documentation is provided by the <TofuPilotLink utmMedium="landing" /> team, offering a plug-and-play database and analytics for OpenHTF tests.

## Quick example

<Row>
  <Col>
    OpenHTF tests are Python scripts that run a series of test steps on a Unit Under Test (UUT), usually involving data and performing measurements.

    OpenHTF handles the setup, execution, and teardown of the test, keeps track of everything gathered and provides a pass/fail outcome.

    Here are the key concepts in OpenHTF:

      <Properties>
        <Property name="Phases">
          Test steps perform actions and return pass, fail, or skip result.
        </Property>
        <Property name="Measurements">
          Capture specific values during phases with optional pass/fail validators.
        </Property>
        <Property name="Plugs">
          Handle external hardware/software interactions with reusable components.
        </Property>
      </Properties>
