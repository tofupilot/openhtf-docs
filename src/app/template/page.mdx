## Running a First Test Bench


Let's create our first testbench and explore the basic concept of the test plan. 

Create a file called `main.py` in the folder in which you installed spintop-openhtf and copy this code.

#### Basic Testbench

```python
# main.py
from openhtf.plugs.user_input import UserInput
from spintop_openhtf import TestPlan

""" Test Plan """

# This defines the name of the testbench.
plan = TestPlan('hello')

@plan.testcase('Hello-Test')
@plan.plug(prompts=UserInput)
def hello_world(test, prompts):
    prompts.prompt('Hello Operator!')
    test.dut_id = 'hello' # Manually set the DUT Id to same value every test

if __name__ == '__main__':
    plan.no_trigger()
    plan.run()

```

In the code above, a test plan is first declared. 
```python
plan = TestPlan('hello')
```

Then, a test case is declared and added to the test plan.
```python
@plan.testcase('Hello-Test')
@plan.plug(prompts=UserInput)
def hello_world(test, prompts):
    prompts.prompt('Hello Operator!')
    test.dut_id = 'hello' # Manually set the DUT Id to same value every test
```

And finally the test plan is executed when the script is launched.
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    plan.no_trigger()
    plan.run_console() 

```

This simple test bench will simply interact with the operator by telling him Hello Operator!. Run it using the created virtual environment :

```bat
# Windows Activate
venv\Scripts\activate 

python main.py
```

This test bench does not use the spintop-openhtf GUI therefore all interactions are made through the command line. The test prints Hello Operator! and indicates a PASS.

```bat
(venv) C:\GIT_TACK\doc_exp>python main.py
Hello Operator!
-->

================ test: hello  outcome: PASS ================
```
