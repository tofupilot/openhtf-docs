# Manufacturing Test Analytics

With TofuPilot, monitor your tests first-pass yield (FPY), and capability index (Cpk) at the test phase level. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

When you deploy your test script, it runs many times, and **issues arise**. Instruments may not connect, **limits might reject good parts**, or some phases take longer than expected. The **best way to troubleshoot** your test scripts is with a **database of test logs and analytics**, but building that adds more work when you're already managing tests, hardware, and production timelines.

We **faced these issues ourselves**, building scrappy analytics while scaling drone manufacturing. We saw many other teams doing the same. So, we built <TofuPilotLink utmMedium="" /> a **plug-and-play analytics platform for hardware test engineers**, on solid web infrastructure, available on cloud or on-premise, and with phase-level test analytics.

It’s OpenHTF-compatible and integrates in 5 minutes. And let us know what you think on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HzkYUWg9PK)!

## TofuPilot integration

To integrate TofuPilot, install the open-source client:

```sh
pip install tofupilot
```

Add it to your test like this:

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
import openhtf as htf
from openhtf.util import units
from tofupilot.openhtf import TofuPilot             # import tofupilot

def phase_one(test):
    return htf.PhaseResult.CONTINUE

@htf.measures(
    htf.Measurement("temperature")
    .in_range(0, 100)
    .with_units(units.DEGREE_CELSIUS)
)
def phase_temperature(test):
    test.measurements.temperature = 25

def main():
    test = htf.Test(phase_one, phase_temperature)
    with TofuPilot(test):                           # add 1-line
        test.execute(lambda: "PCB001")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Each time you run a test, it's automatically uploaded to your workspace.

## Phases and Measurements

After importing your runs, you can visualize the phases and measurements for each run, along with their respective limits and units. This view helps you save time during development by ensuring you have logged the correct parameters.

## First-pass yield (FPY)

On the test procedure page, you'll find **detailed statistics on execution** performance. The most commonly used metric in industrial test monitoring is **First-pass yield** (FPY). It measures the percentage of parts that pass without rework and helps assess the efficiency of the process.

## Process capability index (Cpk)

The Process Capability Index (Cpk) measures **how well a test stays within its limits**. It applies to test phases with numerical measurements and at least one lower or upper limit.
