# Manufacturing Test Analytics

With TofuPilot, monitor your tests first-pass yield (FPY), and capability index (Cpk) at the measurement level. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

When you deploy your test script, it runs many times, and **issues arise**. Instruments may not connect, **limits might reject good parts**, or some phases take longer than expected. The **best way to troubleshoot** your test scripts is with a **database of test logs and analytics**, but building that adds more work when you're already managing tests, hardware, and production timelines.

We **faced these issues ourselves**, building scrappy analytics while scaling drone manufacturing. We saw many other teams doing the same. So, we built <TofuPilotLink utmMedium="" /> a **plug-and-play analytics platform for hardware test engineers**, on solid web infrastructure, available on cloud or on-premise, and with phase-level test analytics.

It’s OpenHTF-compatible and integrates in 5 minutes. And let us know what you think on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HzkYUWg9PK)!

## TofuPilot integration

To integrate TofuPilot, install the open-source client:

```sh
pip install tofupilot
```

Add it to your test like this:

```python {{ title: 'main.py' }}
import openhtf as htf
from openhtf.util import units
from tofupilot.openhtf import TofuPilot             # import tofupilot

def phase_one(test):
    return htf.PhaseResult.CONTINUE

@htf.measures(
    htf.Measurement("temperature")
    .in_range(0, 100)
    .with_units(units.DEGREE_CELSIUS)
)
def phase_temperature(test):
    test.measurements.temperature = 25

def main():
    test = htf.Test(phase_one, phase_temperature)
    with TofuPilot(test):                           # add 1-line
        test.execute(lambda: "SN1234")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Each time you run a test, it's automatically uploaded to your workspace.

## Test Reports

After uploading your runs, you can visualize the phases and measurements for each test run instead of having raw JSON data. This view helps you understand what happened during each test execution, including measurement values, limits, units, but also logger output, attachments, and Device Under Test information.

## Analytics

Beyond individual test visualization, TofuPilot provides analytics across multiple runs to identify patterns and trends. The most commonly used metric in industrial test monitoring is **First-pass yield** (FPY). It measures the percentage of parts that pass without rework and helps assess the efficiency of your test procedures.

## Phases and Measurements Analytics

TofuPilot provides analytics at the individual phase and measurement level for deeper insights into test performance. The Process Capability Index (Cpk) measures **how well measurements stay within their limits**. It's calculated for each individual measurement with numerical values and at least one lower or upper limit. This helps you identify which specific measurements are driving test failures.
