## Overview

**Problem**: Once these scripts are deployed to production computers, you end up with a large volume of tests. It becomes impossible to easily understand what’s failing or where issues are.

**Solution**: Test data management platforms like [TofuPilot](https://tofupilot.com) simplify this by providing:

- **Clear traceability** to track and organize tests
- **Real-time performance monitoring** to quickly identify issues

[TofuPilot](https://tofupilot.com) offers both a **secure cloud workspace** and an **on-premises option** for teams managing their own infrastructure.

As production scales, tracking pass/fail rates becomes harder. Test failures cause:

- 🛑 **Missed Issues**: Faulty products slip through.
- 💸 **High Rework Rates**: More costs and delays.
- 📉 **Inconsistent Quality**: Declining product standards.

## First-pass yield (FPY)

Tracking and optimizing test performance is crucial as production scales. By monitoring key metrics, you can identify inefficiencies, improve throughput, and maintain product quality. Key test performance metrics include:

- **First-pass yield (FPY)**: Percentage of units passing tests without re-test or rework.

- **Cycle time**: Time spent per test cycle.

- **Process capability**: Measures test results against limits.

FPY measures the percentage of units passing all tests on the first try, helping reduce failures and improve efficiency.

_Here, we see the first procedure needs investigation due to low first-pass yield, while the second is fine:_

- ⚡️ **Real-time FPY Calculation**: Continuous tracking of FPY.
- 🚨 **Threshold Alerts**: Alerts when FPY drops below set limits (e.g., 75%, 90%).
- 🔍 **Detailed Breakdown**: FPY breakdown by individual test steps for deeper insights.

With TofuPilot, teams can improve efficiency, reduce rework, and maintain high-quality production.

## Process capability index (Cpk)

// this should be a summary
The Process Capability Index (Cpk) is a key statistical tool used in production and manufacturing to measure how well a process is performing relative to its specification limits. It indicates the ability of a process to produce output within the desired specification limits consistently. {{ className: 'lead' }}

// issue ->

// solution -> track capability measurement

// detail -> all indicators, cp, cpk, pp, ppk

// result -> the most useful is cpk?

// this is not a note

<Note>
  Cpk is only meaningful for test phases that include measurements with both
  defined values and limits.
</Note>

Cpk is a measure of process capability that takes into account both the centering of the process and its variability. It shows how closely a process is running to its specification limits, considering the natural variability in the process.

**Formula:**

```jsx
Cpk = min[(USL - μ) / (3σ), (μ - LSL) / (3σ)]
```

Where:

- USL = Upper Specification Limit
- LSL = Lower Specification Limit
- μ = Process Mean
- σ = Standard Deviation

// illustrate now with tofupilot

A Cpk value of 1.33 or higher is typically considered acceptable, indicating that the process is capable of producing output within specification limits. A Cpk value of less than 1 suggests that the process is not capable, and there is a need for process improvement or control measures.

- Cpk > 1.33: Process is highly capable.
- Cpk = 1: Process is marginally capable.
- Cpk < 1: Process is not capable; improvements are needed.

Improving Cpk is crucial for maintaining consistent product quality and reducing the number of defects. A higher Cpk value indicates a more capable process, with outputs that are more likely to meet the desired specifications. This leads to fewer defects, less waste, and lower production costs.

To visualize your process’s Cpk, simply import your data on TofuPilot, and it will automatically calculate the Cpk values, providing insights into the capability of your processes.
