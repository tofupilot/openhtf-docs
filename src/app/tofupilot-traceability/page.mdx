## Overview

**Problem**: Once these scripts are deployed to production computers, you end up with a large volume of tests. It becomes impossible to easily understand whatâ€™s failing or where issues are.

**Solution**: Test data management platforms like [TofuPilot](https://tofupilot.com) simplify this by providing:

- **Clear traceability** to track and organize tests
- **Real-time performance monitoring** to quickly identify issues

[TofuPilot](https://tofupilot.com) offers both a **secure cloud workspace** and an **on-premises option** for teams managing their own infrastructure.

## Units

Test traceability answers key questions like:

- Was this serial number tested? How many times? Did it pass the first time?
- What part number and revision was it?
- When and where was the test done?

While ERP or MES systems typically handle traceability for parts purchasing and shipment, the automatic test process is often disconnected. Local test logs contain valuable information that gets lost if not properly managed.
