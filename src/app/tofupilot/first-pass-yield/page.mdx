# Monitoring Quality with First-Pass Yield

Managing test results at scale often leads to missed failures and rework. **First-Pass Yield (FPY)** helps identify inefficiencies. [TofuPilot](https://tofupilot.com) automates FPY tracking and breaks it down by individual test steps. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Problem: managing test failures

As production scales, tracking pass/fail rates becomes harder. Test failures cause:

- 🛑 **Missed Issues**: Faulty products slip through.
- 💸 **High Rework Rates**: More costs and delays.
- 📉 **Inconsistent Quality**: Declining product standards.

## Solution: First-Pass Yield

FPY measures the percentage of units passing all tests on the first try, helping reduce failures and improve efficiency.

_Here, we see the first procedure needs investigation due to low first-pass yield, while the second is fine:_

## Implementation in TofuPilot

- ⚡️ **Real-time FPY Calculation**: Continuous tracking of FPY.
- 🚨 **Threshold Alerts**: Alerts when FPY drops below set limits (e.g., 75%, 90%).
- 🔍 **Detailed Breakdown**: FPY breakdown by individual test steps for deeper insights.

With TofuPilot, teams can improve efficiency, reduce rework, and maintain high-quality production.
