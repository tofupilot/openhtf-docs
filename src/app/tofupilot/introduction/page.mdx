# Test Data Managemement

Frameworks like OpenHTF can be used to standardize test scripts and reports, ensuring consistent execution. {{ className: 'lead' }}

**Problem**: Once these scripts are deployed to production computers, you end up with a large volume of tests. It becomes impossible to easily understand what‚Äôs failing or where issues are.

**Solution**: Test data management platforms like [TofuPilot](https://tofupilot.com) simplify this by providing:

- **Clear traceability** to track and organize tests
- **Real-time performance monitoring** to quickly identify issues

[TofuPilot](https://tofupilot.com) offers both a **secure cloud workspace** and an **on-premises option** for teams managing their own infrastructure.

## Test Traceability

Test traceability answers key questions like:

- Was this serial number tested? How many times? Did it pass the first time?
- What part number and revision was it?
- When and where was the test done?

While ERP or MES systems typically handle traceability for parts purchasing and shipment, the automatic test process is often disconnected. Local test logs contain valuable information that gets lost if not properly managed.

## Test Performances

Tracking and optimizing test performance is crucial as production scales. By monitoring key metrics, you can identify inefficiencies, improve throughput, and maintain product quality. Key test performance metrics include:

- **First-pass yield (FPY)**: Percentage of units passing tests without re-test or rework.

- **Cycle time**: Time spent per test cycle.

- **Process capability**: Measures test results against limits.

## OpenHTF + TofuPilot

Connecting your OpenHTF test scripts with TofuPilot is really easy.

### Get started in 5 minutes

TofuPilot integrates seamlessly with OpenHTF.

1. Create your account on [TofuPilot](https://tofupilot.com) and install the TofuPilot open-source Python client:

```bash
pip install tofupilot
```

2. Retrieve your API key from [My Profile](/user-management#api-key) page and save it as an environment variable.

<CodeGroup>
```bash {{ title: 'Linux, macOS' }}
echo 'export TOFUPILOT_API_KEY=[your_key_here]' >> ~/.zshenv
```

```bash {{ title: 'Windows' }}
setx TOFUPILOT_API_KEY "<your_key_here>"
```

</CodeGroup>

3. Add the `report_upload` function to your OpenHTF test scripts:

```python
from tofupilot import Tofupilot

// better example of where in a script from what we're providing before

TofuPilotClient().import_log(file_path='path/to/your/openhtf/log.json')
```

Your test reports will be automatically uploaded and processe by TofuPilot üöÄ

// full functional openhtf script with procedure name etc..

### Build it yourself vs. TofuPilot

You could build your own analytics with Excel or custom solutions, but this option is expensive, slow, and hard to maintain, while taking focus away from more important work.
