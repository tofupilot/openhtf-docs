# Process Capability Index (Cpk)

The Process Capability Index (Cpk) is a key statistical tool used in production and manufacturing to measure how well a process is performing relative to its specification limits. It indicates the ability of a process to produce output within the desired specification limits consistently. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Cpk is only meaningful for test phases that include measurements with both
  defined values and limits.

## Definition

Cpk is a measure of process capability that takes into account both the centering of the process and its variability. It shows how closely a process is running to its specification limits, considering the natural variability in the process.

**Formula:**

```jsx
Cpk = min[(USL - μ) / (3σ), (μ - LSL) / (3σ)]
```

Where:

- USL = Upper Specification Limit
- LSL = Lower Specification Limit
- μ = Process Mean
- σ = Standard Deviation

## Interpretation

A Cpk value of 1.33 or higher is typically considered acceptable, indicating that the process is capable of producing output within specification limits. A Cpk value of less than 1 suggests that the process is not capable, and there is a need for process improvement or control measures.

### Key Points:

- Cpk > 1.33: Process is highly capable.
- Cpk = 1: Process is marginally capable.
- Cpk < 1: Process is not capable; improvements are needed.

## Importance

Improving Cpk is crucial for maintaining consistent product quality and reducing the number of defects. A higher Cpk value indicates a more capable process, with outputs that are more likely to meet the desired specifications. This leads to fewer defects, less waste, and lower production costs.

## Calculation

To visualize your process’s Cpk, simply import your data on TofuPilot, and it will automatically calculate the Cpk values, providing insights into the capability of your processes.
